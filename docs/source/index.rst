Introduction
----------------

A/B testing is process that enables developers and data scientists examine and assess product performance through an experiment.
In this process two or more versions of a variable (web page, page element, products etc.) are shown to different segments of 
visitors to determine which version leaves the maximum impact and drives business value. Based on this feedback one can evaluate the conversion rate
and significance of change based on input. The goal of this library is to create a tool 
which will help in understanding the impact of these experiment.
